age = 18 # variable
print(age) # prints information

age1 = 1 # variable
age2 = 2 # variable

result = 20 / 3 # an operator
print(result)

result = 5 ** 2 # raising a number to the fifth power. (5^)
print(result)

# You can use round instead.
print(round(20/3), 0)

# guess the output:
print(20 / 3 + 1)

# think of it like this because of operator precedence:
print((20 / 3) + 1)

# 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5
print(5**5)

# The remainder of 78 / 11 is 1.
print(78 % 11)
